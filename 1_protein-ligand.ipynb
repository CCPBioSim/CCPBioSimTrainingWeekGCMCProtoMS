    "\n",
    "The data folder for this workshop contains input files for the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The files necessary to set up this kind of simulation have been provided - a pdb file containing the protein structure, here protein.pdb, and a pdb file containing the ligand, here amq.pdb. We can generate all the necessary inputs for the ProtoMS simulation code through use of the python setup tools. A convenient interface is provided by the master script protoms.py. To setup a simulation of our protein-ligand system simply type:\n",
    "\n",
    "> cp data/protein.pdb .\n",
    "\n",
    "> cp data/amq.pdb .\n",
    "\n",
    "> python $PROTOMSHOME/protoms.py -s sampling -p protein.pdb -l amq.pdb --charge -1 -r 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, it should be straightforward to understand the interface. The -s flag is used to request the type of simulation, in this case, simply some vanilla MC sampling, -p gives the input protein structure to use and -l provides the ligand to include in the system. Additional small molecules can be included by providing them as additional arguments to -l. The --charge flag refers to the formal charge of the ligand and is required for setup. The last argument -r 3 requests input files to perform three independent simulations. This is a common approach to lower the statistical uncertainty of the computed quantities. Typically more independent simulations are executed until the uncertainty, estimated as the standard error, falls below an acceptable limit, e.g. 0.5 kcal.mol-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that we provided very little information indeed to set up a complete simulation. There is of course a great deal going on under the hood and, using the above command, ProtoMS is making a lot of decisions on your behalf.  Fortunately, the majority of simulation set up options can be controlled from the command line. For a description of commonly used options (such as the -s and -l flags above) and their arguments you can type:\n",

    "First, the protein is truncated such that any residue further than 20 A from any ligand atom is removed. We call this a protein scoop, and it is used to significantly reduce the computational resources required to run a simulation. By default, residues between 16 and 20 A from the ligand will have their backbone fixed during the Monte Carlo simulation, whilst those less than 16 A are fully flexible. The scoop that is produced can be found in the file protein_scoop.pdb, produced by protoms.py. Inside the file, the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "> REMARK chunk fixbackbone 1 1-2, 14-17, 22, 24-29, 41-45, 55-57, 59, 91-96, 98-99, 101-104, 121-123, 125-126, 129, 133-135, 151-154, 171-174, 192-198, 200-203, 205-206, 209-210, 214-218\n",

    "Second, the protein has been solvated in a droplet of water molecules with a radius of 30 A centred on the ligand(s). Hence, we will not apply periodic boundary conditions to the protein simulations. The droplet is written to a separate file, water.pdb and the first line of this PDB file (below) indicates the centre and radius of the droplet. The last number 1.5 indicates that a semi-harmonic potential with a force constant equal to 1.5 kcal.mol-1.A-1 is applied to water molecules when they move more than 30 A away from the centre of the droplet to prevent them from evaporating.\n",

    "Performing a molecular mechanics simulation with small molecules requires the assignment of suitable parameters. Fortunately, for ProtoMS this process is automatically handled and out sourced to the very capable tools of the Amber simulation package. The antechamber program is used to assign am1-bcc partial charges to ligands whilst bonded and Lennard-Jones parameters are taken from the General Amber Force Field (GAFF). The file amq.prepi was created by antechamber and, combined with amq.frcmod (produced by the ancillary Amber utility parmchk), contains the necessary parameters for simulation. These are used together, along with some additional information, to produce the actual file used by ProtoMS to fully describe AMPA - amq.tem. This is an example of a ProtoMS template file and we will consider it's contents in more detail as some aspects may need to be fine tuned to improve simulation efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of amq.tem are separated into blocks headed by lines beginning with 'mode'. Some of the key sections are highlighted and discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**mode bond/angle/dihedral**: Contain force field parameters that were not present in the default GAFF force field and were generated by the utility parmchk. These parameters are loaded by ProtoMS as a part of template file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**mode clj**: lists atom types, charges and Lennard-Jones parameters for each atom in the solute\n",
    "\n",
    "**mode template**: The atom section lists for each atom in the solute, its name, residue name, forcefield parameters, connectivity. The bond section lists the chemical bonds in the solute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connectivity information is in essence an internal coordinates representation of a molecule of AMPA. This type of data structure is also called a z-matrix. For example the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "> atom  CD2 AMQ 3002 3002   CG AMQ   CB AMQ  DM3 DUM\n",
    "\n",
    "Tells us that atom CD2 is bonded to atom CG, has an angle with CB and a torsion with atom DM3. If you look at the picture below you will see that this is sufficient information to define a molecular topology.\n",
    "Note that the bonds/angles/torsions in the atom lines of the par file do not have to follow chemical bonds. For instance the torsion between atom HE22 and HE23 doesn't and, in fact, is called an improper torsion. The chemical bonds of the molecule should, however, be defined with a set of bond lines.\n",
    "Note that some atoms are bonded to DMX atoms (X=1,2,3). These are dummy atoms. Though they are not present in the molecule of AMPA and not seen in the pdb file, they are added by ProtoMS. The three dummy atoms DM1,DM2,DM3 are present by convention to allow, for instance, a z-matrix entry for atoms CB, CG and CD2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-matrix representation of the ligand is used to allow for the efficient generation of proposal moves in the MC sampling scheme. The simplest scheme by which one may generate novel configurations for an MC simulation, would simply be to choose an atom at random and shift its position slightly. Because of the diverse chemical environments in which atoms may find themselves within a drug-like molecule however, attempting such Cartesian displacements of individual nuclei would be highly inefficient. Instead ProtoMS makes changes within the internal coordinate system provided by the z-matrix, and then maps these changes back to derive the positions of atoms in Cartesian space. Such a scheme allows move proposals that capture concerted motions of atoms e.g. movement of groups around rotable bonds. Towards the end of the template files you will see lines such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> dihedral   CA AMQ   CB AMQ   CG AMQ  CD2 AMQ flex 2.182\n",
    "\n",
    "The final flex keyword indicates that this degree of freedom should be sampled and the following value denotes the range of attempted move sizes (Angstroms for bonds, degrees for angles and dihedrals) that are attempted. You'll notice that by default bonds have no flex term and hence bond lengths will not change for a simulation using this template. Some dihedrals from the z-matrix are not present in the list at the bottom of the system and these are likewise not sampled. These are omitted as they are dihedrals associated with rigid degrees of freedom that show little variability, e.g. ring dihedrals in aromatic residues, and hence may be safely fixed."

Here we have turned on info, and accept. All of the files will be written to the folder indicated by outfolder.\n",

    "* Dumps: This specifies output at specific frequencies. In this example we will write results to the file results and snapshots to all.pdb every 100000th step.\n",
    "* Chunks: This is the part of the command file that actually controls what ProtoMS will do. A complex simulation is usually broken down into different chunks (i.e. steps) during the simulation. Here ProtoMS is instructed to equilibrate for 50 million moves and then simulate for 40 million. The only differences between an equilibration and simulation chunk is that during equilibration, averages are not recorded and outputs from dumps are not written. The various terms following the number of moves e.g. solvent=688 instructs ProtoMS on the relative probabilities to attempt moves of different system components. More move types are available than are shown here and performing different types of moves can fundamentally alter the type of simulation being performed.\n",

    "Equilibration points for the individual series are indicated by the vertical dashed lines. It is apparent from this plot that the rate-limiting factor in convergence of the total energy is interaction between protein and solvent, and to a lesser extent interactions between solvent molecules. Notice that the interaction energies involving the ligand equilibrate much faster than the total energy. This suggests that the interactions of the ligand are largely unaffected by the changing total energy and that the conformations of the ligand and its immediate environment produced in this simulation can be considered representative. To see the interaction energies with the ligand more clearly, we can analyse them separately:\n",

    "\n",
    "Another factor that is important to consider for an MC simulation is the acceptance rate of attempted moves. In the output directory find the accept file. This contains entries for every residue in the system, recording the number of attempted and successful moves. There is an inherent tension in MC between attempted move size and the resulting acceptance rate for the simulation. If your move size is too large your acceptance rate will suffer, but if the move size is too small you will not sample efficiently and simulation convergence will be poorer. Attempted move sizes are directly related to the flexibility parameters provided in amq.tem and discussed above. Find the entry for the ligand AMQ. A good rule of thumb is that your acceptance rate should be in the range of around 20-50\\%. The acceptance rate for AMQ falls comfortably in this range so the default flexibilities in amq.tem from the setup are about right. This will not always be the case however so you should be prepared to modify the flexibility values as required."
